Stuff for doing network labs


Loopbacks
 - Lots of them.
 - When you need a large number of prefixes in your network lab environment.
 - It's easier to copy the text file to the network device via SCP or TFTP or USB device and then copy that file to the running-config.  Copying the contents of the files through a SSH session tends to timeout or take forever.


Narbik OSPF Lab
 - Loopbacks / prefixes to use if you want to lab up Narbik's OSPF LSA class.


Router Lab Pre-configurations
 - If you need to quickly test something, but don't want to spend the time getting a lab up and running.
