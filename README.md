Stuff for doing network labs

Vincent Zhou CCIE SP v3.0 Sample Lab
 - Older, but covers the basic topics for SP
 - 7 parts
 - Uploading here because it's becoming harder to find them on Cisco's website


Loopbacks
 - Lots of them.
 - When you need a large number of prefixes in your network lab environment.
 - It's easier to copy the text file to the network device via SCP or TFTP or USB device and then copy that file to the running-config.  Copying the contents of the files through a SSH session tends to timeout or take forever.


Narbik OSPF Lab
 - Loopbacks / prefixes to use if you want to lab up Narbik's OSPF LSA class.


Router Lab Pre-configurations
 - If you need to quickly test something, but don't want to spend the time getting a lab up and running.


Practice Lab
 - Only setup for IOS devices, to make it light weight enough to not need a beefy server
 - Only has IPv4 and IPv6 addresses configured
 - May be missing some loopbacks
